            sub-selection

        StrainSelector.get_phenotype: Getting data for a certain phenotype

    Examples:

        You can add two selections to make the union of the selections
        Let `s1` and `s2` be `StrainSelector` instances.
        ```s_combined = s1 + s2```

        You can extend a current `StrainSelector` in place too making it
        the union of itself and the other.
        ```s1 += s2```
